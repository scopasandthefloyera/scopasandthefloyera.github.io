      <p>Scopas awoke to a dark and murky night almost as if the moon didn’t exist at all. He threw his legs over the side of his straw made bed and stretched his arms as far as humanly possible.Then he heard a loud crunching from his straw roof. Scopas sat on his bed shuddering in fear as the shuffling grew louder and louder, and just as he was about to dash out of his room, Apollo seemed to appear out of thin air. Scopas sat on his bed speechless, and just as he was about to cough up a single word, Apollo spoke, “Come face to face with me at the field at the crack of dawn.”
Scopas inquired, “But who will drive the Sun Chariot?”
Apollo responded, “My son Phaethon will drive it, but because I do not trust him, I will have to make our battle quick. I must go now.”
