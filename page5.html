      <h1>Falling Action</h1>
      <p>Scopas spent days, months, and even years in that dreadful prison with only one piece of bread and one cup of water a day, and yet he persevered. Apollo barely made visits to him, but if he did visit it would only be to give him more work to do. Scopas was to copy notes for Apollo, and that’s all he would do day after day, month after month, year after year. Meanwhile the the fragment Scopas broke off of the Sun Chariot kept falling and falling, and yet no one really knew why it fell so long and no one will ever know. After just 5 years in prison Scopas realized that the gods truly were better than him, he realized that he never should have challenged a god who was the wiser. What a fool Scopas was, he finally realized what he shouldn’t have done.</p>
