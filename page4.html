      <p>Scopas did as Apollo said and was on his way to the fields a little before the crack of dawn.
Apollo was standing in the center of the fields as he said he would.Scopas didn’t have trouble finding him at all because Apollo’s voice boomed as he said,”You’ve bragged on long enough, and now I challenge you to a contest of Floyeras.”
”Ha, this is going to go faster than I can say Floyera ,”Without a word, Apollo played his golden Floyera and made a heavenly tune that mesmerized Scopas, 
Scopas yelled, “Impossible! How are you so much better than me? AHHH!”, and because Apollo was so much better than Scopas, Scopas gave his Floyera a mighty throw and it shot all the way up to the Sun Chariot SNAP! The Floyera then chipped off a fragment. At that same moment 
Apollo exclaimed,”You Fool! Look at what you have done!”
“For this you shall be thrown into my prison, and swear servitude to me for the rest of your life!”
Scopas did as he was told , and Scopas was thrown in prison and was forced to work for Apollo for the rest of Scopas’ life.
