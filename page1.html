      <p>Scopas is an average farm boy who in his free time practices the Floyera, and has become the best Floyera player in the land. The Floyera is a flute-like instrument, and Scopas believes he is even better than Apollo, the god of music himself! Scopas loves his Floyera and always wants to brag and challenge Apollo, the god of music and the Sun. Apollo has mastery over the Floyera, just as Scopas thinks he does. Scopas is dangerously prideful of his skill with the Floyera. Afterwords,  Scopas was incredibly tired with his work, so he made his way back to his home on the countryside. When he got to his home, he went to sleep, and didnâ€™t wake at all through the night.</p>
