      <h1>Inciting Incedent</h1>
      <p>The next day Scopas walked down the endless rows of wheat, just staring up at the unfathomably blue sky, and he stood there watching and watching. As he was walking, he crashed into his friend Castor Delis, and Castor yells, “Hey! What’s the matter with you?!” 
“Sorry,” Scopas responded, “I was just thinking about how good I am at playing the Floyera!” 
Caster proclaimed, “You’re so full of yourself! See you later you bragger.”
I’ll show him he thought, I hereby challenge Apollo to a contest! 
Then Scopas slowly and pridefully walked home. He slowly approached his house. When he got there he completely ignored his father and went straight to his room.
