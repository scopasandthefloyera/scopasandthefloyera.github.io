      <h1>Resolution</h1>
      <p>After a long 17 years Scopas died , and was surprised to see himself getting passed on to The Elysium, but then he realized that he wasn’t the selfish and boastful person he was before, and that he was a wiser man than before, too. He had learned from Apollo’s punishment, and learned that the god was only trying to help him. Meanwhile after sitting in water for 17 years, the gold that had chipped off of the Sun Chariot had eroded into a goldfish, and that goldfish started repopulating in freshwater. Many many years would pass before the goldfish would be discovered by the Greeks, and the goldfish's name would not be decided for years to come. Scopas would never know that by breaking off a fragment of the Sun Chariot he created a new creature, nor would Apollo know of the goldfish’s creation either. Little did Apollo know that that one goldfish could change everything.</p>
